    <h1>who am i?</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Justin Le (he/they). I'm known as Piksal, PiksalChaos, or Pixi online.
      Don't call me any of those in person though or I'll look at you like <span id="bruhface">(ಠ_ಠ)</span>
    </p>
    <p>I'm a high school junior (assuming that I don't
      forget to update this page) with a bit of a passion for art and computer
      science. I want to make things that are expressive and fun!
    </p>
    <p>
      This website is mostly just a playground for me to experiment.
      Maybe I'll make a professional website, but that's a job for future me.
    </p>

    <h1>what do i do?</h1>
    <p>
      My two main skills and passions are <b>game development</b> and <b>animation</b>.
      I'm always learning something new though, and I'm currently interested in
      getting into webdev and UI/UX.
    </p>

    <h1>what do i use</h1>
    <p>
      I use <b>Godot</b> for game development as of currently, but in the past
      I've had a lot of experience in <b>LOVE2D</b>. <b>Phaser JS</b> is a lot
      of fun too!
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to animation, I'm most experienced with <b>Adobe Animate</b>
      with my school-provided Creative Cloud. I'm shifting towards other software
      though, like <b>Tahoma2D</b> and <b>ToonSquid</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all things pixel-art, my favorite is <b>Aseprite</b>. You can actually
      get it for free if you
      <a href=https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/main/INSTALL.md>
        build it yourself</a>.
      There's also the free and open source <b>Pixelorama</b> if I'm too lazy
      to build Aseprite.
    </p>
    <p>
      For video game music, I use <b>LMMS</b>.
    </p>
